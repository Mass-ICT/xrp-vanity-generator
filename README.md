# 💎 XRP Vanity Address Generator

A lightweight, single-page web application to generate custom XRP "Vanity" addresses (classic addresses) starting with your preferred characters. 

This tool is entirely **client-side**, meaning your private keys are generated in your browser and are never sent to a server. For maximum security, you can run this tool **completely offline**.

## ✨ Features
- **Fast Generation:** Uses Web Workers to search for prefixes without freezing your browser.
- **Privacy First:** Runs 100% locally. No data collection, no APIs, no tracking.
- **Xaman Ready:** Automatically generates a QR code for your **Family Seed** for instant import.
- **Zero Installation:** Just a single HTML file. No `npm install` or complex setup required.

## 🚀 How to Use

1. **Download & Open:** Save the `xrp.html` file to your computer and open it in any modern web browser.
2. **Search:** Enter your desired prefix (the characters you want after the 'r') and click **Start Generating**.
3. **Wait for Match:** Depending on the length of your prefix, it may take a few seconds to a few minutes.
4. **Secure Your Key:** Once a match is found, your **Public Address** and **Secret Key (Seed)** will be displayed.
